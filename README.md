# Cocktails Catalogue

**Hi, there!** This is the first of many-to-come projects that are going to be published in this GitHub profile. My intention is to use the Cocktail Database API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) and create a website where you can search cocktails by name, choose and ingredient and receive a list of possible cocktails that can be made with that ingredient, get a random cocktail, and so on. I'll add more features as I get a feeling of the API and see what can be done with it.

## Which tools are going to be used in this project?

That's a good question. Since I'm currently studying frontend development only, my intention is to use React for the development itself. I won't be using any CSS frameworks in this one, so all styilzation will be done manually.

If you have any comments or just want to get in touch, you can do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpastolfi/). I'll be very happy to know that this has reached someone :grin:
